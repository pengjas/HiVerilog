Please act as a professional Verilog designer.
Implement a modular Dual-mode Arithmetic Unit for 16-bit integers. In the dual_mode_arithmetic module, there are submodules for addition and subtraction. The dual_mode_arithmetic module selects either addition or subtraction based on the mode input.

Module name:
    dual_mode_arithmetic

Input ports:
    clk: Clock signal used for synchronous operations.
    rst: Reset signal. Defined as 1 for reset and 0 for reset signal inactive.
    mode: Mode selection signal. Defined as 0 for addition and 1 for subtraction.
    a: 16-bit input operand A.
    b: 16-bit input operand B.

Output ports:
    result: 16-bit output representing the arithmetic result.

Implementation:
The module includes:
Adder Submodule:
This submodule takes two 16-bit inputs (a and b) and produces a 16-bit result of their addition.
Subtractor Submodule:
This submodule subtracts the input B from input A and outputs a 16-bit result.
The main dual_mode_arithmetic module uses a multiplexer controlled by the mode input to select between the outputs of the adder and subtractor submodules and drives the output result accordingly.
