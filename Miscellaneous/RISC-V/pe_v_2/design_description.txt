Please act as a professional Verilog designer.
Design a modular Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) for 32-bit integers. The top module, alu_module, should integrate submodules for addition, subtraction, bitwise AND, and bitwise OR operations. The alu_module connects these submodules to perform the specified operation based on an operation selector input.

Module name:
    alu_module

Input ports:
    clk: Clock signal for synchronous operations.
    a: 32-bit input operand A.
    b: 32-bit input operand B.
    op_sel: 2-bit operation selector (00 for ADD, 01 for SUB, 10 for AND, 11 for OR).

Output ports:
    result: 32-bit output representing the ALU operation result.

Implementation:
The module includes:
Adder Submodule:
    This submodule takes two 32-bit inputs and provides a 32-bit output of their sum.
Subtractor Submodule:
    This submodule takes two 32-bit inputs and provides a 32-bit output of their difference.
AND Submodule:
    This submodule performs a bitwise AND operation on two 32-bit inputs to produce a 32-bit output.
OR Submodule:
    This submodule performs a bitwise OR operation on two 32-bit inputs to produce a 32-bit output.
The main alu_module uses the operation selector to choose which submodule's output to route to the main output result.
