Please act as a professional Verilog designer.
Implement a module of a 32-bit arithmetic logic unit (ALU) that performs addition, subtraction, and bitwise AND operation using submodules for each function in combinational logic.

Module name:
    alu_32bit

Input ports:
    A [31:0]: First 32-bit input operand.
    B [31:0]: Second 32-bit input operand.
    op [1:0]: Operation selector where 00 = addition, 01 = subtraction, 10 = AND.

Output ports:
    result [31:0]: 32-bit output result of the selected operation.
    carry_out: 1-bit output for carry (relevant in addition and subtraction).

Implementation:
Operational Logic: The ALU selects between addition, subtraction, and AND operations based on the operation selector 'op'.
Adder and subtractor modules handle arithmetic operations, generating both result and carry/borrow outputs.
AND operation is handled by a separate bitwise AND submodule.
The top module (alu_32bit) instantiates these submodules and uses multiplexing logic to choose the correct output based on the operation selected.
