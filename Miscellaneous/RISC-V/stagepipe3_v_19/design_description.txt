Please act as a professional Verilog designer.
Implement a module for a simple 4-bit arithmetic logic unit (ALU) that performs addition, subtraction, bitwise AND, and bitwise OR based on a 2-bit operation selector.

Module name:  
    simple_alu               
Input ports:
    a[3:0]: 4-bit input operand.
    b[3:0]: 4-bit input operand.
    op[1:0]: 2-bit operation selector where 00 is ADD, 01 is SUBTRACT, 10 is AND, and 11 is OR.
Output ports:
    result[3:0]: 4-bit output result of the ALU operation.

Implementation:
The simple_alu module instantiates four submodules: adder, subtractor, and_module, and or_module. Each submodule performs a specific operation based on the operation selector 'op'. The adder module calculates the sum of a and b. The subtractor module calculates the difference between a and b. The and_module performs a bitwise AND operation, and the or_module performs a bitwise OR operation. The output of each submodule is connected to a multiplexer, which selects the final result based on 'op'.
