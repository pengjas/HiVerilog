Please act as a professional Verilog designer.
Implement a module for a 4-bit arithmetic logic unit (ALU) with basic arithmetic and logical operations.

Module name:  
    simple_alu               
Input ports:
    clk: Clock signal.
    rst: Reset signal, active high.
    op_code[1:0]: 2-bit operation code to specify the ALU operation.
    data_a[3:0]: 4-bit input operand A.
    data_b[3:0]: 4-bit input operand B.
Output ports:
    result[3:0]: 4-bit output resulting from the specified ALU operation.
    zero: Output high when result is zero.

Implementation:
In the simple_alu module, the basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction) and logical operations (AND, OR) are supported. The op_decoder submodule interprets the op_code and triggers the corresponding operation in the arithmetic_logic submodule. The result_manager submodule checks the result from arithmetic_logic and outputs a zero flag if the result is zero.
