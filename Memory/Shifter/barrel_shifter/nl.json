{"natural language": "- The `cin` input of the top module is connected to the `cin` input of submodule FA0. - The `cout` output of each submodule FA0 through FA6 is connected as the `cin` input to the next submodule in sequence (e.g., `cout` of FA0 to `cin` of FA1, and so on). - The `a` and `b` inputs of the top module are connected to the corresponding `a` and `b` inputs of each submodule (FA0 through FA7). - The `sum` outputs of each submodule (FA0 through FA7) are connected to the corresponding bits of the `sum` output of the top module. - The `cout` output of the last submodule, FA7, is connected to the `cout` output of the top module."}
