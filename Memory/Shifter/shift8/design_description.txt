Please act as a professional Verilog designer.

A top-level module designed to instantiate three 8-bit D flip-flops (my_dff8) and connect them to create an 8-bit wide shift register of length 3. Additionally, implement a 4-to-1 multiplexer that selects the output based on a 2-bit select signal (sel), which determines the delay of the input signal (d) through the shift register.

Module name:
top_module

Input ports:
clk: Clock signal for synchronization.
d [7:0]: 8-bit data input to be shifted through the register.
sel [1:0]: Control signal that selects which output to present (0-3 cycles of delay).

Output ports:
q [7:0]: The output data after the selected number of clock cycles.

Implementation:
The top_module consists of three instances of my_dff8, each representing a D flip-flop. The output of each flip-flop is connected to the next one, creating a chain that allows the input data to be shifted through the register.
The output q is determined by the sel input, which selects the output of the appropriate flip-flop or the original input d based on the number of cycles to delay
