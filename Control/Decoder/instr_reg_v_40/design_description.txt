Please act as a professional Verilog designer.
A data multiplexer module designed to route data from multiple inputs to a single output based on a control signal. This module uses submodules for handling data from various sources, aggregating the selected data into a single output channel for downstream processing.

Module name:
    data_mux

Input ports:
    clk: Clock signal for synchronization.
    sel [1:0]: Control signal to select the input source.
    in0 [7:0]: 8-bit data from input source 0.
    in1 [7:0]: 8-bit data from input source 1.
    in2 [7:0]: 8-bit data from input source 2.
    in3 [7:0]: 8-bit data from input source 3.

Output ports:
    out [7:0]: The selected 8-bit data output.

Implementation:
    The data multiplexer is implemented using four submodules, each responsible for holding data from a distinct source.
    On the rising edge of the clock (clk), if the sel signal selects an input, the corresponding submodule outputs its stored data to the main output.
    Each submodule reacts to changes in the input data when the selection signal matches its specific code, otherwise it retains the previous value.
    The output port out directly reflects the data from the selected submodule.
