Please act as a professional Verilog designer.
Design a binary counter module that increments the count by one on every rising edge of the clock, using three T flip-flops configured to toggle their state. The counter should reset to zero when the reset input is high.

Module name:
    binary_counter

Input ports:
    clk: Clock signal for synchronization.
    reset: Reset signal to reset the counter to zero.

Output ports:
    count: 3-bit output reflecting the current count value.

Implementation:
The binary counter consists of three instances of the provided T flip-flop module (my_tff). Each flip-flop's output represents a bit of the binary count. The first T flip-flop toggles on every clock cycle. Each subsequent T flip-flop toggles when all lower-order bits are high. A synchronous reset is applied to each flip-flop.
