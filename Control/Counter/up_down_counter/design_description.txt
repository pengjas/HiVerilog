Please act as a professional Verilog designer.

Module name:
    up_down_counter

Function:
A 16-bit counter that can increment or decrement based on control signals, implemented in a modular fashion.

Input ports:
    - clk: Clock signal (1-bit), used to synchronize the counting process.
    - reset: Reset signal (1-bit), used to reset the counter to zero.
    - up_down: Control signal (1-bit), determines the counting direction.
    If up_down = 1, the counter increments; if up_down = 0, it decrements.

Output ports:
    - count [15:0]: 16-bit output representing the current counter value.

Implementation:
The module consists of two submodules: counter_logic and counter_register.
- The counter_logic module calculates the next count value based on the current count and control signals.
- The counter_register module updates the current count value on the rising edge of the clock signal or resets it based on the reset condition.
The count output reflects the current value of the counter, which can range from 0 to 65535.
