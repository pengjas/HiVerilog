Please act as a professional Verilog designer.
Design a Priority Encoder in Verilog, which encodes an 8-bit input into a 3-bit output code corresponding to the highest order '1' found in the input.

Module name: 
    priority_encoder

Function:
    An 8-bit Priority Encoder which scans the input from the most significant bit (MSB) to least significant bit (LSB). It outputs a 3-bit binary code representing the position of the highest order bit that is set to '1'. If no bits are set, an additional 'valid' output is set to '0'.

Input ports:
    in [7:0]: 8-bit input where each bit will be scanned to find the highest order '1'.

Output ports:
    code [2:0]: 3-bit output code indicating the position of the first '1' from MSB.
    valid: Output signal that indicates if the output code is valid (i.e., at least one '1' is present in the input).

Implementation:
    The priority encoder checks each bit of the input starting from the MSB using a series of conditional checks and logic gates. If a '1' is detected, the corresponding binary code for the position is set at the output. The output 'valid' is set to '1' if any '1' is detected across all bits; otherwise, it remains '0'.
    The process involves using multiple instances of a `check_bit` submodule, which determines if the current inspected bit is '1' and if it is the highest order '1' found so far based on priority logic.
