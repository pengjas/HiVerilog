{"natural language": "- The input port `a0` is connected to the submodule `pe0`. - The input ports `clk` and `rst` are connected to both `pe0` and `pe1`. - The input port `b0` is connected to both `pe0` and through internal logic in the top module, it is also passed to `pe1` after processing. - Similarly, the input port `a1` is connected to the submodule `pe1`. - The output of submodule `pe0` is connected to the output port `c0`. - The output of submodule `pe1` is connected to the output port `c1`.
