{"natural language": "  1. `pe0` receives the `clk` and `rst` signals directly from the top module's inputs. It also receives `a0` and `b0` from the top module's inputs. The output `c0` of `pe0` is directly connected to the top module's output `c0`.   2. `pe1` similarly receives the `clk` and `rst` signals directly from the top module's inputs. The input `a1` is directly connected to `pe1`, while `b1` is cascaded from `pe0`'s `b0` output through internal connections (`b1 <= b0`). The output `c1` of `pe1` connects directly to the top module's output `c1`.   3. `pe2` is configured to receive `clk` and `rst` as well as `a2` directly from the top module's inputs. The `b2` input for `pe2` is sourced from `pe1`'s `b1` output, forming a cascade (`b2 <= b1`). The output `c2` of `pe2` connects directly to the top module's output `c2`.   4. `pe3` receives `clk`, `rst`, and `a3` directly from the top module's inputs. It gets its `b3` from `pe2`'s `b2` output (`b3 <= b2`). The output `c3` of `pe3` is directed to the top module's output `c3`."}
