Please act as a professional Verilog designer.
Implement a module of an 8-bit multiplier that uses modular design principles.

Module name:
    mult_8bit

Input ports:
    X[7:0]: 8-bit input operand X.
    Y[7:0]: 8-bit input operand Y.

Output ports:
    P[15:0]: 16-bit output representing the product of X and Y.

Implementation:
The top module mult_8bit uses a series of add_shift modules to perform the multiplication operation through repeated additions based on the shifting method. Each add_shift module is responsible for conditionally adding the multiplicand X shifted left by a specific number of positions to an accumulator based on a corresponding bit in the multiplier Y.
