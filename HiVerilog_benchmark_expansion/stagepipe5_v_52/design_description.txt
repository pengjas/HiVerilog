Please act as a professional Verilog designer.
Implement a simple arithmetic logic unit (ALU) that performs four functions: addition, subtraction, bitwise AND, and bitwise OR operations based on a 2-bit control input.

Module name:
    simple_alu
Input ports:
    clk: Clock signal.
    rst: Reset signal, active high.
    op_code[1:0]: Control signal to choose the operation (00 for addition, 01 for subtraction, 10 for AND, 11 for OR).
    operand_a[31:0]: 32-bit input operand A.
    operand_b[31:0]: 32-bit input operand B.
Output ports:
    result[31:0]: 32-bit result of the operation.

Implementation:
In the simple_alu module, four operations are instantiated: add, subtract, bitwise_and, and bitwise_or. The add module performs addition of operand_a and operand_b. The subtract module performs subtraction of operand_b from operand_a. The bitwise_and module performs a bitwise AND operation between operand_a and operand_b. The bitwise_or module performs a bitwise OR operation between operand_a and operand_b. The selected result from these operations is output based on the op_code input.
