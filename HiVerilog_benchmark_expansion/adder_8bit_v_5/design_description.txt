Please act as a professional Verilog designer.
Implement a module of a 4-bit multiplier using a series of full adders in sequential logic.

Module name:  
    multiplier_4bit               
Input ports:
    a[3:0]: 4-bit input operand A.
    b[3:0]: 4-bit input operand B.
Output ports:
    product[7:0]: 8-bit output representing the product of A and B.

Implementation:
The module utilizes a series of full adders and shift registers to perform the multiplication operation.
