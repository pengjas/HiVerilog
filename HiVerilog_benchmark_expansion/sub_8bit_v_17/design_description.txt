Implement a module of a 4-bit multiplier using a combination of adders and shift registers.

Module name:
    mult_4bit

Input ports:
    X[3:0]: 4-bit input multiplicand X.
    Y[3:0]: 4-bit input multiplier Y.

Output ports:
    P[7:0]: 8-bit output representing the product of X and Y.

Implementation:
The top module mult_4bit utilizes a series of shift and add operations implemented through adder_4bit modules. Each adder_4bit module handles the addition based on the shifted value of X and the bit value of Y.
