Please act as a professional Verilog designer.
Implement a modular 32-bit Integer Divider and Subtractor system using Verilog. The main module, named `ds`, should include submodules for division and subtraction. It connects these to perform the operations, handling 32-bit integers.

Module name:
    ds

Input ports:
    clk: Clock signal for synchronous operations.
    rst: Reset signal, high to reset, low otherwise.
    x: 32-bit dividend input.
    y: 32-bit divisor input.
    z: 32-bit subtrahend input.

Output ports:
    quotient: 32-bit output for the division result.
    difference: 32-bit output for the subtraction result.

Implementation:
The module includes:
Divider Submodule:
This submodule takes two 32-bit inputs (x and y) and calculates the division, providing a 32-bit quotient.
Subtractor Submodule:
This submodule takes the division result and a 32-bit input z, computing the subtraction (quotient - z) and outputting a 32-bit difference.
The main `ds` module integrates these submodules, outputting the results for quotient and difference.
