Please act as a professional Verilog designer.
Implement a module for a 4-bit multiplier using shift and add method in combinational logic.

Module name:  
    multiplier_4bit               
Input ports:
    a[3:0]: 4-bit input multiplicand.
    b[3:0]: 4-bit input multiplier.
Output ports:
    product[7:0]: 8-bit output representing the product of A and B.

Implementation:
The module uses a series of bit-shifts and add operations controlled by the bits of the multiplier.
