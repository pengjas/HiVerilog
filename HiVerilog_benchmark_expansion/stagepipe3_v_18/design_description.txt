Please act as a professional Verilog designer.
Design and implement a Verilog module for a simple 4-bit arithmetic logic unit (ALU) with basic operations including addition, subtraction, AND, OR operations.

Module name:  
    simple_alu4bit               
Input ports:
    clk: Clock signal.
    op_code[1:0]: 2-bit operation selector.
    operand_a[3:0]: 4-bit input operand A.
    operand_b[3:0]: 4-bit input operand B.
Output ports:
    result[3:0]: 4-bit output result of the ALU operation.

Implementation:
The simple_alu4bit module consists of four primary operational stages: adder, subtractor, and_logical, or_logical. Each stage is implemented as a separate submodule that performs the specific arithmetic or logical operation based on the op_code input. The adder stage computes the sum of operand_a and operand_b. The subtractor stage computes the difference between operand_a and operand_b. The and_logical stage performs a bitwise AND operation, and the or_logical stage performs a bitwise OR operation. The result from the appropriate submodule is selected based on the op_code and output through the result port.
