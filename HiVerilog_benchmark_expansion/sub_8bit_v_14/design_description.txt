Please act as a professional Verilog designer.
Implement a module of an 8-bit multiplier that uses modular design principles.

Module name:
    mult_8bit

Input ports:
    X[7:0]: 8-bit input operand X.
    Y[7:0]: 8-bit input operand Y.

Output ports:
    P[15:0]: 16-bit output representing the product of X and Y.

Implementation:
The top module mult_8bit combines the products from multiple instances of the gen_product module, which calculates partial products. Each gen_product module handles the multiplication operation for one bit of Y with all bits of X and accumulates the results using shift and add methodology.
