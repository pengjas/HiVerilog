Implement a module of an 8-bit subtractor using multiple bit-level subtractors in combinational logic.

Module name:  
    subtractor_8bit               
Input ports:
    a[7:0]: 8-bit input operand A.
    b[7:0]: 8-bit input operand B.
    bin: Borrow-in input.
Output ports:
    diff[7:0]: 8-bit output representing the difference of A from B.
    bout: Borrow-out output.

Implementation:
The module utilizes a series of bit-level subtractors (full subtractors) to perform the subtraction operation.
