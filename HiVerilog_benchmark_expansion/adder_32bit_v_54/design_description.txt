Please act as a professional Verilog designer.
Implement a module of a 32-bit binary subtractor that employs a series of 8-bit subtractor blocks to perform the operation, and handles borrow-in and borrow-out.

Module name:  
    subtractor_32bit               
Input ports:
    A[32:1]: 32-bit input operand A.
    B[32:1]: 32-bit input operand B.
    Bin: Borrow-in input.
Output ports:
    D[32:1]: 32-bit output representing the difference of A minus B.
    Bout: Borrow-out output.

Implementation:
The top module subtractor_32bit consists of several instances of the 8-bit subtractor block you design.
