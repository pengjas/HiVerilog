Please act as a professional Verilog designer.
Implement a modular 32-bit Adder-Subtractor using Verilog. In the top module named `as_module`, instantiate submodules for addition and subtraction. The `as_module` orchestrates these submodules to perform either addition or subtraction based on a mode input.

Module name:
    as_module

Input ports:
    clk: Clock signal for synchronous operations.
    rst: Reset signal, high to reset, low otherwise.
    mode: Operation mode, 0 for addition and 1 for subtraction.
    op1: 32-bit input operand 1.
    op2: 32-bit input operand 2.

Output ports:
    result: 32-bit output, result of addition or subtraction.

Implementation:
The module includes:
Adder Submodule:
This submodule takes two 32-bit inputs (op1 and op2) and produces a 32-bit result of their addition.
Subtractor Submodule:
This submodule subtracts the second 32-bit input (op2) from the first (op1) and outputs the 32-bit result.
The main as_module module uses the mode input to select and output the result from either the Adder or Subtractor submodule based on the operation mode.
