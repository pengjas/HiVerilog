Please act as a professional Verilog designer.
Design a Verilog module named `adder_selector` that performs an 8-bit addition of two input numbers (a, b). The module should also have a submodule that decides if the result should be output directly or zeroed based on a control signal (ctrl). If ctrl is high, output the result of the addition; if ctrl is low, output zero.

Module name:
    adder_selector

Input ports:
    a [7:0]: 8-bit input representing the first number.
    b [7:0]: 8-bit input representing the second number.
    ctrl: Control signal that determines the output behavior.

Output ports:
    sum [7:0]: The 8-bit output which is either the sum of a and b or zero based on the ctrl signal.

Implementation:
The top_module `adder_selector` contains an instance of an 8-bit adder `my_adder8` and uses a conditional statement in always block to decide the output based on ctrl signal. It sets the output `sum` to either the result of the addition or zero.
