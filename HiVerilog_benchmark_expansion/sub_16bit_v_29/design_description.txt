Please act as a professional Verilog designer.
Implement a module of a carry-lookahead 16-bit adder that uses the Carry-Lookahead Adder (CLA) architecture.

Module name:
    add_16bit
Input ports:
    A[16:1]: 16-bit input operand A.
    B[16:1]: 16-bit input operand B.
Output ports:
    S[16:1]: 16-bit output representing the sum of A and B.
    C_out: Carry-out output.

Implementation:
The top module add_16bit consists of several instances of the 4-bit full adder block you design.
