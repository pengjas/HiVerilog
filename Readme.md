## ALL Remaining Tasks to be Checked

#### Additionally, each verified code file should be named `verified_xxx.v` (where `xxx` is the folder name). In this `.v` file, the top module's name should also be `verified_xxx`. The top module in `testbench.v` should be `testbench()`.

## Tasks listed below
### testbench is correct, but source code is wrong.
