Please act as a professional Verilog designer.
Design and implement a 32-bit comparator module in Verilog which uses hierarchical structure with 8-bit comparator submodules.

Module name:  
    comparator_32bit               
Input ports:
    a[31:0]: 32-bit input operand A.
    b[31:0]: 32-bit input operand B.
Output ports:
    equal: Output signal that is high when A equals B.

Implementation:
The comparator_32bit module should utilize four instances of an 8-bit comparator submodule. Each submodule compares corresponding sections of the inputs and the results are combined to produce the final output.
