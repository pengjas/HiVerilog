Please act as a professional Verilog designer.
Implement a module for a 16-bit parity generator which computes the even parity for two 8-bit inputs using a two-level hierarchical design.

Module name:
    parity_16bit               
Input ports:
    X[7:0]: 8-bit input operand X.
    Y[7:0]: 8-bit input operand Y.
Output ports:
    P: Single output representing the even parity of the combined 16 bits of X and Y.

Implementation:
The top module parity_16bit consists of instances of 8-bit parity generator blocks, followed by a final parity computation of their outputs.
