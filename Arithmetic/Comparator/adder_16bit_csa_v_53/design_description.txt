Please act as a professional Verilog designer.
Implement a module of a 16-bit comparator using combinational logic that outputs equality, greater than, and less than signals.

Module name:
    comparator_16bit
Input ports:
    a[15:0]: 16-bit input operand A.
    b[15:0]: 16-bit input operand B.
Output ports:
    eq: Output signal that is high if A equals B.
    gt: Output signal that is high if A is greater than B.
    lt: Output signal that is high if A is less than B.

Implementation:
The comparator_16bit is built using multiple 4-bit comparator slices. Each 4-bit comparator slice outputs local equality, greater than, and less than signals. These outputs are then combined in a hierarchical manner to deduce the overall relationship between the 16-bit inputs A and B.
