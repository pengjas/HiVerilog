{"natural language": "- Inputs `A` and `B` of the top module are split and connected to the corresponding inputs of `CLA1` and `CLA2`. Specifically, `A[16:1]` and `B[16:1]` are connected to `CLA1`, while `A[32:17]` and `B[32:17]` are connected to `CLA2`. - The `S` output of `CLA1` and `CLA2` is connected to the `S` output of the top module, such that `S[16:1]` is driven by `CLA1` and `S[32:17]` is driven by `CLA2`. - The carry-out `c16` from `CLA1` is used as the carry-in `c0` for `CLA2`. - The final carry-out `C32` from `CLA2` is driven to the `C32` output of the top module."}
