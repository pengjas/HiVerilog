Please act as a professional Verilog designer.
Design a 32-bit adder using Verilog, incorporating a set of 8-bit submodules for the addition process. Each submodule should perform 8-bit addition with carry in and carry out.

Module name:
    adder_32bit

Input ports:
    A [31:0]: First 32-bit input operand for addition.
    B [31:0]: Second 32-bit input operand for addition.
    Cin: Carry input for the least significant bit addition.
Output ports:
    Sum [31:0]: 32-bit output sum of A and B.
    Cout: Carry output from the most significant bit addition.

Implementation:
Addition Logic: The module adds two 32-bit numbers A and B by using cascaded 8-bit adder submodules that handle carry propagation.
Modular Design: The main module (adder_32bit) instantiates four 8-bit adder submodules (adder_8bit). Carry outputs of each submodule are chained to the carry inputs of the next higher submodule, starting from the least significant to the most significant.
