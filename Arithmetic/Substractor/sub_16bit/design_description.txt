Please act as a professional Verilog designer.

Implement a module of a borrow-lookahead 16-bit subtractor that uses the Borrow-Lookahead Subtractor (BLS) architecture.

Module name:
    sub_16bit               
Input ports:
    A[16:1]: 16-bit input operand A.
    B[16:1]: 16-bit input operand B.
Output ports:
    D[16:1]: 16-bit output representing the difference of A and B.
    B_out: Borrow-out output.

Implementation:
The top module sub_16bit consists of several instances of the 4-bit full subtractor block you design.
