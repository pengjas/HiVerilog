Please act as a professional Verilog designer.

Implement a module of a 32-bit subtractor that uses a modular architecture.

Module name:
sub_32bit

Input ports:
A[31:0]: 32-bit input operand A.
B[31:0]: 32-bit input operand B.

Output ports:
Diff[31:0]: 32-bit output representing the difference of A and B.
B_out: Borrow-out output.

Implementation:
The top module sub_32bit consists of two instances of a 16-bit subtractor block you design.

Please provide the complete code.
