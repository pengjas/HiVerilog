Please act as a professional Verilog designer.

Implement a module of a 64-bit subtractor that utilizes a hierarchical architecture consisting of submodules for modular design.

Module name:  
    sub_64bit               
Input ports:
    A[63:0]: 64-bit input operand A.
    B[63:0]: 64-bit input operand B.
Output ports:
    D[63:0]: 64-bit output representing the difference A - B.
    B_out: Borrow-out output.

Implementation:
The top module sub_64bit consists of two instances of the 32-bit subtractor module, which in turn consists of two instances of the 16-bit subtractor module, and each 16-bit subtractor contains two 8-bit subtractor modules.
