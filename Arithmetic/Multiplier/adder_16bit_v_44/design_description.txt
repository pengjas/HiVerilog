Please act as a professional Verilog designer.
Design a 32-bit binary multiplier using combinational logic that multiplies two 16-bit binary numbers.

Module name:  
    multiplier_32bit               
Input ports:
    x[15:0]: 16-bit input operand X.
    y[15:0]: 16-bit input operand Y.
Output ports:
    prod[31:0]: 32-bit output representing the product of X and Y.

Implementation:
In the multiplier_32bit module, you will need to design a smaller bit-width multiplier (8-bit multiplier), which will be instantiated multiple times.
