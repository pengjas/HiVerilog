Please act as a professional Verilog designer.
Implement a module of a 4-bit multiplier using a series of adders and shift operations.

Module name:
    mul_4bit

Input ports:
    X[3:0]: 4-bit input operand X.
    Y[3:0]: 4-bit input operand Y.

Output ports:
    P[7:0]: 8-bit output representing the product of X and Y.

Implementation:
The top module mul_4bit performs multiplication by using bitwise AND operations and shifts to construct partial products, which are then added using an adder_8bit module. The adder_8bit module is composed of full_adder modules to handle the addition of each bit.
