Please act as a professional Verilog designer.

Implement a Triangle Wave signal generator module that generates a waveform by incrementing and decrementing a 5-bit signal named wave. The waveform cycles between 0 and 31, which is incremented or decremented by 1.

Module name:
    signal_generator

Input ports:
    clk: Clock signal used for synchronous operation.
    rst_n: Active-low reset signal. Defined as 0 for reset and 1 for reset signal inactive.

Output ports:
    wave: 5-bit output waveform signal representing the generated waveform.
    
Implementation:
The module is divided into two submodules: a state control module and a waveform generation module.

State Control Module:
This module manages the state transitions used to control the waveform generation.
It contains a 2-bit register state that determines whether the waveform is in the incrementing or decrementing phase.
On reset (~rst_n), the state is set to 00.
Waveform Generation Module:
This module generates the waveform by maintaining a 5-bit register wave.
The waveform is incremented when the state is 00 and decremented when the state is 01.
It resets the wave to 0 on reset.
The waveform generation continues to cycle between 0 and 31 based on the state transitions, controlled by the clk signal.
