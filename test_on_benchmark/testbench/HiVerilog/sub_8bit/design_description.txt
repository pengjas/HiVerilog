Please act as a professional Verilog designer.

Implement a module of an 8-bit subtractor that uses modular design principles.

Module name:
    sub_8bit

Input ports:
    A[7:0]: 8-bit input operand A.
    B[7:0]: 8-bit input operand B.

Output ports:
    D[7:0]: 8-bit output representing the difference of A and B.
    B_out: Borrow output indicating if a borrow was generated during the subtraction.

Implementation:
The top module sub_8bit generates the 2's complement of B and utilizes an adder_8bit module to perform the subtraction operation. The adder_8bit module consists of multiple instances of the full_adder module to handle the addition of each bit.
