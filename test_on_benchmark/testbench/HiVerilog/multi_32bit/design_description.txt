Please act as a professional Verilog designer.

Implement a module of a 32-bit multiplier using an array multiplier architecture.

Module name:
multiplier_32bit
Input ports:
A[31:0]: 32-bit input operand A.
B[31:0]: 32-bit input operand B.
Output ports:
P[63:0]: 64-bit output representing the product of A and B.

Implementation:
The top module multiplier_32bit consists of several submodules, including a 64-bit adder for summing the partial products generated from the multiplication process.
