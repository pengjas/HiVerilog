Please act as a professional Verilog designer.

Implement a modular Multiplying Accumulator for 32-bit integers. In the pe module, there are submodules for multiplication and accumulation. The pe module connects these submodules to perform the operations.

Module name:
    pe

Input ports:
    clk: Clock signal used for synchronous operations.
    rst: Reset signal. Defined as 1 for reset and 0 for reset signal inactive.
    a: 32-bit input operand A.
    b: 32-bit input operand B.

Output ports:
    c: 32-bit output representing the accumulated result.

Implementation:
The module includes:
Multiplier Submodule:
This submodule takes two 32-bit inputs (a and b) and produces a 64-bit result of their multiplication.
Accumulator Submodule:
This submodule accumulates the lower 32 bits of the multiplication result into a register, current_value. It resets the value to 0 when rst is high and adds the new multiplication result during each clock cycle when rst is low.
The main pe module connects these submodules and drives the output c with the accumulated result.

Give me the complete code.
