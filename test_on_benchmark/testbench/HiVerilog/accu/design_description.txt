Please act as a professional Verilog designer.

Implement a modular design for a serial input data accumulator. The system should receive 8-bit data inputs and accumulate the values. The valid_in signal will indicate when new data is ready for accumulation. After receiving four valid input data, the module should output the accumulated result and set valid_out to 1 for one cycle.

Module name:
    accu
Input ports:
    clk: Clock input for synchronization.
    rst_n: Active-low reset signal.
    data_in[7:0]: 8-bit input data for addition.
    valid_in: Input signal indicating readiness for new data.
Output ports:
    valid_out: Output signal indicating when four input data accumulations have been reached.
    data_out[9:0]: 10-bit output data representing the accumulated sum.

Implementation:
The design consists of the following submodules:
Counter Module: Counts the number of valid input data received. It resets after counting four inputs.
Data Accumulator Module: Accumulates the four received data_in values and maintains the accumulated result.
Valid Output Module: Generates the valid_out signal, which is set to 1 when four inputs have been accumulated.
