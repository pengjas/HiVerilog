Implement a module of a 16-bit carry select adder in combinational logic.

Module name:
    carry_select_adder_16bit
Input ports:
    a[15:0]: 16-bit input operand A.
    b[15:0]: 16-bit input operand B.
    cin: Carry-in input.
Output ports:
    sum[15:0]: 16-bit output representing the sum of A and B.
    cout: Carry-out output.

Implementation:
The carry_select_adder_16bit is built using a 4-bit ripple carry adder and several 4-bit carry select adder slices. The initial 4-bit section uses a ripple carry adder. Subsequent sections use carry select adder slices, which compute sums and carry-out bits based on the previous carry. Each 4-bit carry select adder slice includes two ripple carry adders and a multiplexer to select the appropriate sum and carry based on the carry-in.
