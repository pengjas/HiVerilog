Please act as a professional Verilog designer.

You are to design a shift register module that utilizes three instances of a D flip-flop. The shift register should shift the input data through each flip-flop on the rising edge of the clock.

Module name:
    shift_reg

Input ports:
    clk: Clock signal for synchronization.
    d: Data input to be shifted through the register.

Output ports:
    q: The output from the last flip-flop in the chain.

Implementation:
The shift register consists of three instances of the provided D flip-flop module (my_dff).
Each flip-flop's output is connected to the next flip-flop's data input, creating a chain effect.
The clock signal is connected to all instances to ensure synchronized operation.
